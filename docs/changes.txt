Alterations to Code
1 Tried changing smiley.show to happy.show, output was eyes are now open, step backwards.

Didn't work because it needed an instance to work with, happy was on its own, needs a  instance to work with.

2 Tried changing self.show to smiley.show, got traceback error, said self was not defined,
 probably same thing; needs smiley instance to work correctly.

3 Tried putting describe.show instead of smiley.show but came back with traceback saying describe is not defined, probably because describe is not defined in the main file.

4 Tried putting print(smiley.describe) and received the following output:
Eyes are now open
False
Eyes are now open

5 (Most significant- Tried changing describe in Happy file to true, received the following output:
Eyes are now open
True
Happy face with open eyes
Eyes are now closed
Happy face with closed eyes
Eyes are now open
Happy face with open eyes

6 Tried calling describe_state function before blink def in Happy file, said describe_state was not defined.

7 Tried calling describe_state after print(smiley.describe(), similar output to above, probably because describe_state is not in main.
8 Tried putting describe variable in smiley instance and setting value to True.
No errors, task accomplished.
